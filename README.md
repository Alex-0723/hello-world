# hello-world
This is for anyone to use. A place to share ideas, info, and dreams.

The owner of this file, Alex Wu, is a 11-year old boy with autism. Contrary to the internet's popular beliefs, I have renowned intelligence in many general areas (except art; I will usually rely on friends for that one), and am more than capable or helping a worthy cause, no matter the difficulty.
